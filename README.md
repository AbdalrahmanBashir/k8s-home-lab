# k8s-home-lab

This repository documents my Kubernetes home lab journey.

- Currently running: Ubuntu 24.04, kubeadm v1.33, Calico CNI with VXLANCrossSubnet.
- Verified networking with a sample nginx deployment.
- Next steps: deploy real applications, add observability, and integrate Ingress/LoadBalancer for production-like workflows.
